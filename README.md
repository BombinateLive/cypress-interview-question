# Bombinate - Cypress Technical Interview
This is a simple To-Do React app designed to help writing Cypress test cases. Interview candidates should run the app to get familiar with the app itself then write some test cases in the `cypress/integration/app_spec.js` file.

* There are Cypress custom commands to help writing the test cases at `cypress/support/commands.js`

## Installation
`npm install`

## Start web server
